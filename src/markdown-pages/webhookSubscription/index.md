Webhook subscriptions allow you to define which events in VersionOne can fire webhooks.

By supplying a URL to an external system and a list of events that should trigger a webhook, you can inform that external system any time the event occurs in VersionOne.

You are able to create and edit webhooks to be as broad or specific as you'd like. For example, you can use webhooks to receive an HTTP request to the external system any time any Story Status changes, or any time a Story in Project A that is owned by Susan has a Status change.

By configuring the event with `from`, `filter`, `with`, and `select`, you can get very specific about which changes you want to be notified about in VersionOne.

    <div class="content">
        In the first release of webhook subscriptions, your instance can have up to 5 enabled webhook subscriptions at a time! Hang tight for looser restrictions.
    </div>

## External System

The external system can be configured by adding a `url` to the webhook subscription.
If the external system requires an authorization token, you can add it as an `authorizationHeader`. This field will be sent as the HTTP Authorization Header each time an event triggers the webhook to be sent.

The `webhookId` will be helpful for you to query or update this webhook later, so make it meaningful and unique, if possible.

Add a short `description` to keep track of what this webhook is used for, such as where this webhook will be sent and why.

<aside class="notice">
    <div class="content">
        Responding back to VersionOne with any status code other than a HTTP Status Code 200 OK will result in a failure to send. Five consecutive failed deliveries can cause the webhook subscription to be disabled, so check the retry count on your subscription if you think your webhook has stopped working.

## Event Types

VersionOne keeps track of any time an Asset is created, or updated. This allows us to create powerful webhook events modeled around Assets and their Attributes. Each event has a `type` from one of the following:

- AssetCreated
- AssetChanged

If I want a webhook triggered any time a Story changes, my event would look like:

```json
{
  "type": "AssetChanged",
  "from": "Story"
}
```

You can also include an array of `attributes` that will allow you to specify which attributes of the asset you'd like to trigger webhooks. Omitting the `attributes` field will notify you of any changes to the asset.

If I want a webhook triggered any time a Story Status changes, my event would look like:

```json
{
  "type": "AssetChanged",
  "from": "Story",
  "attributes": ["Status"]
}
```

We can enhance our event even more by filtering out Stories that don't meet a specified criteria using the `filter` and `with` fields. If I only want to know about Story Status changes for Stories in my Project, the event would look like:

```json
{
  "type": "AssetChanged",
  "from": "Story",
  "attributes": ["Status"],
  "filter": ["Scope=$Scope"],
  "with": {
    "$Scope": "Scope:0"
  },
  "userContext": "Memeber:1002"
}
```

Many assets in VersionOne are secured by their relationship to a Scope (Project) limiting a member's ability to access a resource. We can configure the webhook to query on behalf of a sepcific user using the `userContext` field. Without this field, all assets independent of their relationship to Scope can produce webhooks. In the following case, only Status changes to Stories visible to Member 1002 will produce webhooks.

```json
{
  "type": "AssetChanged",
  "from": "Story",
  "attributes": ["Status"],
  "userContext": "Memeber:1002"
}
```

When the webhook is fired, we might want details about the Story whose Status changed. You can use the `select` field to pick which of the Story's Attributes will be included in addition to the Asset's Oid. For example, if you want to know the Name of the Story and the Name of each of Owner of the Story, your event would look like:

```json
{
  "type": "AssetChanged",
  "from": "Story",
  "attribute": ["Status"],
  "filter": ["Scope=$Scope"],
  "with": {
    "$Scope": "Scope:0"
  },
  "select": ["Name", "Owners.Name"]
}
```

## Webhook

The webhook itself will include many details about the event that has occurred within VersionOne.

In each event object, the webhook will include the `webhookId`, which will allow the external system to identify which webhook subscription the response is associated with. It will also include a `sequenceId`, which will allow the system to determine the order in which the events occurred, along with the timestamp. This means your external system may receive the events out of order, but you can used the sequence id to guarantee that the order is accurate!

The webhook will also include information about the instigator, or the user who enacted the change in VersionOne that triggered the webhook, such as their name, role, email, and more.

Next, the webhook contains the target asset and changes, which will specify the asset on which the changes were made, as well as what those changes were.

The final section is the snapshot, which includes the information requested in the `select` field of the event type definition in your webhook subscription. Say you want webhooks fired when a Story Status changes, but when you receive the webhook you want to know specific details about the Story whose Status changed. By including attributes of the Story in your `select`, you can receive that projection of the Story in the webhook `snapshot`.

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "webhookId": "YYY",
      "sequenceId": 1,

          "act": "Set"
        },
        {
          "name": "Owners",
          "new": "Member:20",
          "act": "Added"
        }
      ],
      "snapshot": [
        {
          "_oid": "Story:123",
          "Owners.Name": [
            "Administrator"
          ],
          "Owners.ID": [
            { "_oid": "Member:20" }
          ],
          "SubsAndMe.Owners.Name": [
            "Administrator"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
